#### Points: 3.00

<hr>

### Description:

Create a function called `reduceRight` that accepts an array, a starting value and an iterating function. **Instead of iterating over the array from left to right, the `reduceRight` function iterates from right to left**. (it starts from the last element in the array (at the end of the array) and stops at the first element in the array argument)
